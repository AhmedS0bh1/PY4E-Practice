# üêç Python for Everybody ‚Äì Practice Projects

This repository contains small Python projects that I built while studying the **PY4E (Python for Everybody)** course by Dr. Charles Severance.  
Each project focuses on applying specific Python concepts like file handling, regular expressions, and data analysis using dictionaries and lists.
